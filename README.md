# PHP-Backend-Website
Here I Upload My Website's Code Which Has PHP Backend.

<h2>Fasion Is On</h2>
<p>This website is a simple affiliating website. Where we can add product's description and a affiliate buying link. (e.g. Amazon Affiliate). And all the information will store in our SQL database (PHPmyAdmin)...</p>
<p>This is now on under development. So, this website might not work properly. So, wait for the final result..</p>
<p style="color:red;">To Open This website, We have to start "Apache Server", "MySQL Database". I do this using "XAMPP"..
